Skill Name (N) / Rating (R)
- Have deployed Hashicorp's Consul in production and developed some tooling around it.
  Also have some familiarity with Serf, a gossip protocol implementation.

Part 2: Our engineering team uses a Lisp called Clojure and strongly favours the Functional Programming paradigm. Will you be comfortable switching from your current technology stack, to Clojure/FP?

Although I have never used Clojure to write any production level system, I am familiar with it and have written some toy programs to explore the language. I believe I can grasp the concepts in a decent amount of time.

Part 3: A small programming challenge.
Design an efficient program that picks the first N among a sorted array of numbers representing customer ratings from -5 to 5 based on sentiment . Positive or Negative Sentiments are ranked higher than median/unbiased ones. eg: -4 should be sorted higher than 3; 2 sorted higher than -1; 5 is sorted higher than 4, and -5 is sorted higher than -4, etc. The array may be of any size < 100, will be un-sorted, and you need to pick only N. You can use any language you like.

The code is hosted at https://github.com/cskksc/sentiment-sort. I have written it in two languages, in Clojure and in Go.
I know its not recommended to upload binaries to a git repo, but to compile a Go binary, all the Go tools and environment has to be setup. To avoid this effort I am including the binaries for osx and linux in the repo.
